# DeepDive-AI
RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) application

# Project Description
The aim is to build an application that facilitates understanding and extracting insights from complex AI research papers. Users can upload a research paper, ask questions, and get precise answers based on the content of the paper. This project focuses on enabling researchers, students, and enthusiasts to navigate and comprehend scientific literature efficiently.

# Key Features
Paper Upload:
    Allow users to upload AI research papers in PDF format.
Query-Based Retrieval:
    Implement a semantic search to retrieve specific sections or paragraphs related to user queries.
Summary Generation:
    Generate concise summaries of key sections (e.g., abstract, methodology, results).
Interactive Q&A:
    Provide users with answers to natural language questions based on the paper's content.
Citation Assistance:
    Offer citation suggestions for specific sections or ideas in the paper.
Multi-Paper Support (optional):
    Allow users to query across multiple research papers.

# Steps to Build
1. Data Handling
Extract text from research papers, ensuring proper handling of sections like:
Abstract
Introduction
Methodology
Results and Discussion
Conclusion
Handle multi-column layouts and citations.
2. Data Preprocessing
Clean and tokenize the extracted text.
Chunk the content into manageable sections (200-500 words).
Add metadata such as section headings and page numbers.
3. Embedding Creation
Use sentence embeddings to create vector representations of the chunks.
Store embeddings in a vector database for efficient retrieval.
4. Query Processing
Accept user queries in natural language.
Perform semantic search in the vector database to retrieve relevant chunks.
Pass the retrieved chunks to the LLM for generating detailed responses.
5. Frontend Development
Build a user-friendly interface where users can:
Upload research papers.
Input queries.
View retrieved sections and AI-generated responses.

# Example Use Case
Input:
    "What is the main contribution of the paper?"
Process:
    Retrieve relevant sections from the paper's abstract and conclusion.
    Use an LLM to generate a response combining retrieved information.
Output:
    "The main contribution of the paper is the introduction of a novel transformer-based architecture that improves model efficiency by 25% while maintaining state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets."
